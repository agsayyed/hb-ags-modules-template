## Why Hugo Modules?

Hugo modules are a powerful feature that allows you to create reusable components and share them across different Hugo sites. They enable better organization of your code, promote reusability, and simplify the management of dependencies. By using Hugo modules, you can encapsulate functionality, styles, and assets in a structured way, making it easier to maintain and extend your projects.

### Hugo Modules are Go Modules

Hugo modules are built on top of Go modules, which means they follow the same principles of versioning and dependency management. This allows you to leverage the Go ecosystem for managing your Hugo projects, ensuring that your modules are versioned correctly and can be easily shared with others.

## HBstack Framework and Hugomods

HBStack is a framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Hugo modules, providing additional features and conventions for building reusable components. It allows you to create modules that can be easily integrated into Hugo sites, leveraging the power of Hugo's templating system while adhering to best practices for modular development.
